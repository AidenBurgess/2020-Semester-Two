too much shit in main, it has all the students, courses, registrations, marks professors
Main handles GUI as well. Choices are delegated to StudentMgr, CourseMgr, CourseRegistrationMgr, MarkMgr
GUi handled with double nested do while loop



FILEMgr is 1163 lines long, and handles loading for all the files, insane

Every class handles reading input and writing output themselves

As a result, all the output text is separated into different files

Error handling done through ValidationMgr class

Each Mgr class has a base class which it creates

StudentMgr adds a student by calling .add() on the Main.students static field ðŸ¤¢

HelpInfoMgr displays the -h messages, unsure if this needs to be refactored somehow 

Course is a big boi and super indented

Domain/Storage classes: Professor, Student, Course, CourseRegistration, Group, MainComponent, Mark,

LabGroup, LectureGroup, TutorialGroup extend Group but don't do anything further

CourseWorkComponent is the only abstract class, MainComponent and SubComponent extend this class

Student is generating studentId atm, shouldnt be their responsibility


Lots of do while loops for some reason that are huge


Mgr classes are generally way too big and have lots of responsibilities (input, output, saving, etc..)

Could definitely use some builders in the house

Methods are generally way too long, should watch "Clean Code" by Uncle Bob
