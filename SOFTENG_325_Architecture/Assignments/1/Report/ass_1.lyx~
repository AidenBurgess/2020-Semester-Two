Design Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section of the report, the issues within subsections are ordered
 by criticality.
 Issues are categorised in the usefulness category if they refer to the
 content, although this may overlap with the fit for use section.
 If issues could fit into multiple categories, they are shown in the most
 relevant category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system goal for the AskAuckland web page is to provide information relating
 to a user's query regarding the University.
 Therefore, searching should be fast, easy, and accurate.
 The content should relate to students of the University (both current and
 future).
 Issues are things that hinder this ideal experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Usefulness Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching does not appear to support the Maori language.
 As Maori is commonly spoken and an official language of NZ, there are accessibi
lity issues.

\begin_layout Standard
A simple search for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

academic integrity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has many results relating to academic integrity.
 However, academic integrity is never defined in the articles.
 Furthermore, none of the links in the articles leads to a definition of
 academic integrity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next to some articles, there is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Updated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flag; however, the date of the post/update is not visible.
 This lack of specificity limits the functionality of this feature.
 The time posted is essential for these articles as they may become outdated.
 An article from five years ago is not as relevant as one posted six months
 ago.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking for a lecture room is also difficult.
 It requires going to the sixth result after searching 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

campus map
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and requires four clicks to reach the city campus map pdf.
 This also makes it inefficient for use, as this process would need to be
 repeated each time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When searching 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exam
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the coronavirus topic, there is one result which is not relevant to
 exams.
 This would be a fairly common question asked, but there does not appear
 to be information on the AskAuckland site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no search results for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coffee
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This type of search should be covered as it would be a commonly asked question.

Fit for Use Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The search for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 yields twelve results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further specifying the search by adding the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coronavirus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topic reduces search results to just two results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of topics seems to be faulty.
 The titles of some of the removed articles are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Self-isolation in accommodation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Holding accommodation if still in China
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Making changes to your graduation application
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These results would be useful for students, so having them filtered out
 when using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coronavirus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topic is counter-intuitive and not good user experience.
 Therefore, the functionality of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

topics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is compromised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another potential issue with the topic feature is removing a topic from
 a search by clicking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Current students
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 under topic removes the search term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ease of Learning Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hover effects for links are variable, with most being underlined, but some
 being underlined and highlighted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The search button does not get underlined or highlighted; only the mouse
 cursor is changed to a pointer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most clickable aspects are shown in blue.
 However, the current breadcrumb is clickable but not blue.
 A further question is why the current breadcrumb is clickable, as it provides
 no functionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another anti-pattern is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Example: How do I pay my fees?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section, which is blue but not clickable.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typing in a word then hovering over the 'x' icon does not change the mouse
 cursor to a pointer which is an anti-pattern, a little confusing.
 Also, the 'x' icon has a small hit-box, making it harder to click.

\begin_layout Section
Nielson's Heuristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nielson's heuristics are a general guideline on user interface design.
 In this section, these ten characteristics will be examined in regards
 to six scenarios:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What a current student should do about COVID-19
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What support for Maori students is available
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How to find a specific lecture theatre
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What is academic integrity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Find out where to get a coffee on campus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ask about something in the Maori language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process for gathering issues started with an observation and exploration
 of the main AskAuckland web page, looking specifically for anti-patterns
 and visual issues.
 Following this, the scenarios were carried out while constantly examining
 signs of usability issues.
 These were all recorded and then categorised into the ten heuristics.
 The criticality of each item is noted and determined by the impact on users
 trying to perform a scenario.
 There are three levels of criticality: low, medium, and high.
 If an issue completely blocks a scenario, then it is of high criticality,
 while an issue that annoys a user would be of low criticality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Visibility of system status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Previous Clicked Link Not Purple - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A convention across many websites is to colour links purple if they have
 been previously visited.
 This helps the user recognise what they have used before for future searches.
 Although missing this feature reduces the ability of users to identify
 articles they have already visited, it is not severe enough to hinder any
 tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: If a user has visited an article before, the link in the search
 results should be purple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Match between system and the real world
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maori Language Support - High Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching does not work if the language used to search is Maori.
 There is also no option to change the language of the site to be in Maori.
 Maori is an official language of New Zealand; people who can only speak
 Maori would not be able to use the AskAuckland site.
 Consequently, this issue can ultimately hinder a user from completing the
 primary task of searching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename no-results-maori.png
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Either translate Maori and search using the translation or implement
 Maori language support with a switch language button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
User control and freedom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Search Term Not Saved - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When in an article, clicking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Current students
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 breadcrumb does not preserve the search term used to find the article.
 A user who would like to visit multiple articles would be annoyed by this
 issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename blank-search.PNG
	scale 55

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Add another breadcrumb which is shown when in articles, allowing
 the user to go back to their previous search term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Consistency and standards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Choosing Topic Eliminates Relevant Results - High Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covid-19
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yields twelve results, adding the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coronavirus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topic reduces the number of results to two.
 This is disconcerting as the topic and search terms are synonyms, but many
 important results are omitted.
 Therefore, the risk is high that users would miss articles and not be able
 to complete their scenario if they encounter this issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename covid-after.PNG
	scale 65

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Better tagging of search results, articles which mention coronavirus
 should be tagged with the corresponding topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inconsistent Link Styling - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most links are coloured blue, there are some exceptions.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Example: How do I pay my fees?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 paragraph is not a link although it is blue.
 Although the current breadcrumb is not coloured blue, it is a link.
 Links in the footer are white.
 Hover animations for links vary as well: underlining, highlighting, and
 no animation.
 This issue is only a minor annoyance for users and would not prevent any
 from completing their task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename blue-antipattern.png
	scale 55

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Make all links blue, with underline hover animation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error prevention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Misspelling Not Checked - Medium Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is quite a common mistake for users to make.
 So the fact that there is no indication that there has been a misspelling
 (something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No results, please check your spelling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is an issue.
 If a user is not a native English speaker or their spelling is not accurate,
 this error could prevent them from completing a scenario, but most users
 would recheck their search term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename misspelling.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Instead of the message 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No results found.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 add the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please recheck your spelling.

 to the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recognition rather than recall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Search Term Not Shown - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When inside an article, it is not clear which search term was used to reach
 this article.
 If a user leaves the page, they may forget what they were looking for.
 Most of the time, a user should be able to tell what search term was used,
 so this issue would only be a minor hindrance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename search-not-saved.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Include the search term as an additional breadcrumb on the article
 page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Flexibility and efficiency of use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mandatory Selection of Future or Current Student - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature is a roadblock for experienced users.
 It limits the speed at which users who are used to the site can ask a question,
 but does not hinder particular scenarios greatly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Save the previous answer in a cookie and use that for future sessions.
 Or on the homepage, have a search bar on top which can be used immediately.

\begin_layout Subsection
Aesthetic and minimalist design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Only two results showing - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top bar and containing the University of Auckland logo and the topic

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename save-space.png
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Move the logo to the left-hand side of the screen and move up
 the main content of the page.
 Replace the topic section with a drop-down list in alphabetical order (Hick-Hym
an Law).
 Making these changes should result in an extra four results available without
 scrolling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unclear Error Message - Medium Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although error messages were rare, there were occasions where searching
 for something after the site had been idle results in an error message.
 The error message is not useful for the user.
 After searching again, the warning did not occur.
 This is a confusing experience for the user.
 Some users may leave the site after receiving a message like this or think
 there is something wrong with the search term, so the impact is moderate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename error-message.PNG
	scale 65

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Use a more meaningful error message for the user such as

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main purpose of the AskAuckland website is to get answers to commonly
 asked questions.
 If a question returns no results, there is currently no indication of how
 else the user can receive a response.
 Scenarios such as looking for coffee the definition for academic integrity
 are not possible due to this inflexibility.

\begin_layout Section
Impacts of Human Memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current state of the website does have considerable concern for human
 memory limitations.
 However, there are some areas which can be improved to improve the user
 experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recognition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using known patterns in the user interface allows users to recognise them
 and learn how to use the website faster.
 Here are some examples used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Blue colour for links
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Underline links on hover with the mouse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search field appearance and functionality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A loading GIF appears after clicking the search icon, indicating the user
 to wait on the current page and that their input has been recognised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The site also takes advantage of known logos and icons to aid in recognition;
 they are also more readable than words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The logo in the top left corner is consistent in both look and functionality
 as the one on auckland.ac.nz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename main.PNG
	scale 75

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The previous and next icons are recognisable and have the same hover effect
 as links, indicating they can be clicked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename prev-next.png
	scale 70

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the search section, the search icon and the two delete icons are easily
 recognisable, although the two delete icons are not the same shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename icons.png
	scale 55

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another issue is with the hover functionality of the delete icon in the
 search field.
 There is no hover effect, which contradicts the other buttons on the page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When an element on the web page has functionality that a user is familiar
 with but uses a different pattern, this makes the interface more difficult
 to learn.
 The topic section is an anti-pattern.
 The functionality of the topic section is to allow the user to pick one
 item from a list of items to refine the search.
 However, this type of functionality is already covered by a drop-down.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

	scale 55

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cognitive Load
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lowering the amount of information that needs to be held in the user's head
 at one time reduces stress.
 In the website, many features support the user's working memory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Topics shown on the results page and updates when picking a new topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After clicking the search button, the results appear on the same page as
 the search without clearing the search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Breadcrumbs show where you are on the site as well as whether you are on
 current student or future student.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The names of topics are all short, with an average of 1.75 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user task stack is small, so if someone is interrupted when searching,
 they should be able to return to that page and recall their task.
 This effect further enhances these issues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An issue is that removing a topic removes the search term.
 The user may forget this piece of information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another issue is the search term not visible on article pages, leading to
 the same problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, these two issues are alleviated by the recently viewed section
 feature.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shortcuts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A useful feature for experienced users is the physical affordance of typing
 enter instead of clicking the search button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the website has areas of improvement, but there are already many
 features which counteract human memory limitations.
\end_layout
