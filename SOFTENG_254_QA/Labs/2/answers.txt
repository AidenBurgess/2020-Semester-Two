Play around with @Before and @After. What happens if you have two methods with the same annotation? Does the order matter?
Order does not matter. No guarantee as to which one is called first and which is called second.


Try putting @Ignore before different methods. Does it behave the same for @Test compared with @After or @Before? Does it matter what order it is (before @Test or after it)?
It just ignores that method, does not matter whether it is directly before or after @Test.
