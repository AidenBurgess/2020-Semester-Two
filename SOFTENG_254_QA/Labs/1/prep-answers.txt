What is the command (from the command line) you use to compile a Java class?
javac

What is the command you use to execute a Java program?
java

Suppose you have a library library.jar you want to use. What flag do you need to use to to specify the use of this library?
-cp which means classpath
e.g. java -cp "Test.jar:lib/*" my.package.MainClass

Suppose your current working directory contains the directory se254, which in turns contains the directory lab1, which contains the two files ClassA.java and ClassB.java. ClassA.java has the declaration for the class se254.lab1.ClassA, and also has a main method. This class uses se254.lab1.ClassB, which is declared in the file ClassB.java.
What single command could you use to use to compile the two classes described above without changing your current working directory? (Hint: What wild cards might be useful?)
javac ./lab1/*.java

When you try to compile se254.lab1.ClassA, what does the compiler do when it encounters the use of se254.lab1.ClassB?

What single command possibly different from your first answer could you use to use to compile the two classes described above without changing your current working directory that does not involve wild cards?
javac ClassA.java ClassB.java

What is the complete command you would use to execute the main method in the file ClassA.java?
java ClassA

What are the full names of the classes you will be using in the lab?
se254.lab.junitreview.Stats 
.....
