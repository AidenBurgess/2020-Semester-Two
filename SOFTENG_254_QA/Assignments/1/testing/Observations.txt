Most often failed jars are badK and badM, which check that whitespace following a newline is removed and hyphen at start
of text with linewidth of 1.

Many students did not make sure the error message was correct. This is incorrect because an IUT could throw the wrong
exception and the test cases would not detect this fault.

Many students did not explain the test case and had javadocs like "Tests the case where input is null". Instead something like "In the case where the input is null,
the IUT should throw a IOException with the text..."

Some students used single line comments instead of multi-line comments. Javadocs requires the use of multi-line comments.

1. Copy runTests.sh into parent folder of "text"
2. Copy bad jars, good jar, junit-4.13, and hamcrest into the parent folder of "text"
3. Copy TestFlushLeft.java into "text" folder
4. Open parent folder in command line (bash).
5. Run ./runTests.sh OR ./runTests.sh quiet
