Most often failed jars are badK and badM, which check that whitespace following a newline is removed and hyphen at start
of text with linewidth of 1.

Many students did not make sure the error message was correct. This is incorrect because an IUT could throw the wrong
exception and the test cases would not detect this fault. (Although no one lost marks for this)

Many students did not explain the test case and had javadocs like "Tests the case where input is null". Instead something like "In the case where the input is null,
the IUT should throw a IOException with the message..."

Instead of putting a timeout with every @Test, you can setup a global timeout at the top using @Rule

Some students used single line comments instead of multi-line comments. Javadocs requires the use of multi-line comments.
